## 1. **The Basics: What is Astral Chaser?**

Astral Chaser combines classic match-3 puzzle gameplay with hero collection and RPG progression. In each battle, you match gems to launch attacks, charge abilities, and outsmart your enemies.

## 2. **Combat Overview**

### Match-3 Mechanics
- **Goal:** Match 3 or more gems of the same color to trigger attacks or skills.
- **Turns:** Each move lets you swap adjacent gems. Matching more than 3 creates combo effects for extra damage or bonuses.
- **Gem Colors:** Each color is tied to a hero on your team. Matching their gems powers up that hero’s attack and charges their special skill.

### Example
- Match 3 yellow gems: Your yellow hero attacks and their skill meter fills.
- Combo multiple matches: All matching heroes attack in sequence for bonus effects.

## 3. **Heroes, Rarity & Factions**

### Hero Rarities
- **Normal**: Balanced stats, reliable skills.
- **Rare**: Better stats and abilities.
- **Super Rare**: Strong stats, unique skills.
- **Ultra Rare**: Top stats, powerful and rare.
- **Legendary**: The strongest, often gods or goddesses.

### Factions
Each hero belongs to a Faction which shapes their abilities and stats. For example:
- **Tricked Gods**: Can spawn extra gems but trade off raw attack power.
- **Doomfists**: Attack before matches, high offense and defense.
- **Nightmares of the Deceased**: Generate special gems for big combo attacks.
- **Legion of Extinction**: Boosts team attack if many of the same type or color.
- **Angelic Privilege**: Use skills instantly on turn 1, but lower attack.

Each faction has its own unique playstyle. Experiment to find your favorite!
